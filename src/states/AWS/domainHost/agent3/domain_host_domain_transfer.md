# Transferring a Domain from name.com to AWS

1. **Log in** to your name.com account.
2. **Navigate** to the domain you wish to transfer.
3. **Unlock** the domain (if applicable).
4. **Obtain** the transfer authorization code (EPP code) from the domain details page.
5. **Log in** to the AWS Management Console and navigate to Route 53.
6. Choose '**Registered Domains**' > '**Transfer Domain**'.
7. **Enter** the domain name and **follow the prompts**, including entering the transfer authorization code.
8. **Review** and **complete** the transfer process, providing contact information and accepting terms as needed.
9. **Note**: The transfer may take up to 7 days. You can monitor the transfer status in Route 53.

## Important Considerations

- Ensure that the domain's email address is accessible, as confirmation emails may be sent.
- Review name.com's specific transfer policies and AWS Route 53's transfer requirements to ensure a smooth transfer.
