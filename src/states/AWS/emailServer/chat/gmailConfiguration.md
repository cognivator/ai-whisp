In order to use Gmail as your email client with Amazon SES, you need to add the SES SMTP settings to Gmail. Here are the steps:

## Obtain the SMTP Settings from AWS SES:

In the AWS Management Console, navigate to the Amazon SES console. Under the "SMTP Settings" section, note down the Server Name, Port, and the SMTP username and password that you created.

## Configure Gmail to Send Emails via AWS SES:

1. Sign in to your Gmail account, and click on the settings gear icon, then select 'See all settings'.
2. Go to the 'Accounts and Import' or 'Accounts' tab.
3. In the 'Send mail as' section, click on 'Add another email address'.
4. In the new window that opens, enter your name and the email address that you verified in Amazon SES. Make sure to uncheck 'Treat as an alias'.
5. Click on 'Next Step', and in the SMTP server field, enter the Server Name you obtained from AWS SES. Enter the SMTP username and password in their respective fields and the port number (usually 587). Make sure to choose 'Secured connection using TLS'.
6. Click on 'Add Account'.

After completing these steps, Gmail sends a confirmation email to the address you added. Open that email and click the confirmation link in it, or enter the confirmation code in the 'Accounts and Import' section of the Gmail settings page.

Please note that to ensure high-quality service for all users, Amazon SES sets certain limits on the amount of email you can send. It's also important to follow AWS's guidelines to maintain a high email sending reputation.

If you plan to send a large volume of emails, you should also consider setting up a process to handle bounce and complaint notifications, to ensure you do not send emails to recipients who have marked your emails as spam or have invalid email addresses. This can be achieved by using Amazon SES's notification features in combination with other AWS services such as S3, SNS, or Lambda.
