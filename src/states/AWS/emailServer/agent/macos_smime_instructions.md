# Configuring S/MIME on MacOS

S/MIME (Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) is a protocol used to encrypt emails and digitally sign them. Here are the instructions to enable and use S/MIME on MacOS:

1. **Enable S/MIME on MacOS**
   - Open the Mail app.
   - Click on "Mail" in the menu bar and then "Preferences".
   - Click on the "Accounts" tab and then on the email account you want to work with.
   - Click on the "Server Settings" tab.
   - Check "Sign outgoing messages using S/MIME".

2. **Send a signed email**
   - Compose a new email.
   - Click on the button next to "From" to sign the email.

3. **Check if an email you received is encrypted**
   - Open the email.
   - If it's signed, you'll see "Signed" in the header.

Please note that to use S/MIME, both the sender and the receiver must have S/MIME enabled. If the recipient doesn't have S/MIME enabled, you won't be able to send encrypted emails to them.
