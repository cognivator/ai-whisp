# Configuring S/MIME on iOS

S/MIME (Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) is a protocol used to encrypt emails and digitally sign them. Here are the instructions to enable and use S/MIME on iOS:

1. **Enable S/MIME on iOS**
   - Open the Settings app.
   - Tap on "Mail".
   - Scroll down and tap on "Accounts".
   - Tap on the email account you want to work with.
   - Tap on "Account" at the top.
   - Tap on "Advanced" at the bottom.
   - Under the "Mailbox Behaviors" section, toggle on "S/MIME".
   - Below that, tap on "Sign" and toggle it on.

2. **Send a signed email**
   - Open the Mail app and compose a new email.
   - You'll see a checkmark in the upper right. That shows the message will be signed.

3. **Check if an email you received is encrypted**
   - Open the email.
   - If it's signed, you'll see a checkmark in the header.

Please note that to use S/MIME, both the sender and the receiver must have S/MIME enabled. If the recipient doesn't have S/MIME enabled, you won't be able to send encrypted emails to them.
