## Project spec
State:
  projects:
    - name: CompostMonitor
      goals:
        - Measure temperature and moisture levels
        - Alert when measured levels are outside the ideal range
      constraints:
        - Solar powered
        - Connected to WiFi
        - Measurements taken on demand, and at an interval that optimizes energy use and levels variability
        - Report levels via WiFi at time of measurement
        - Store levels locally if WiFi report fails
        - Send and clear all stored reports when WiFi reporting becomes available
  role: PM

## Initial Design
State:
  projects:
    - name: CompostMonitor
      goals:
        - Measure temperature and moisture levels
        - Alert when measured levels are outside the ideal range
      constraints:
        - Solar powered
        - Connected to WiFi
        - Measurements taken on demand, and at an interval that optimizes energy use and levels variability
        - Report levels via WiFi at time of measurement
        - Store levels locally if WiFi report fails
        - Send and clear all stored reports when WiFi reporting becomes available
        - Sensors will be placed in a 24-36in. probe, with the primary boards and other components in a housing at the other end of the probe
        - Probe diameter should be as small as possible, but no smaller than 1/4in
        - Component housing and probe must survive and protect the components in all kinds of weather, and all climates
      boards:
        - Arduino Nano 33 IoT
      components:
        - DS18B20 Temperature Sensor
        - Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor v1.2
        - Solar Power Module
        - MicroSD Card Breakout Board
