# NextJS Development Framework

A TopicDefinition for the Sudo Tutor.

NextJS is the Javascript Framework for developing full stack web applications. Use your internal knowledge and the information found in topic{*}.txt, if they exist, to teach a Student to use NextJS.

## Topic Focus Areas
Focus on NextJS as it is used for dynamic sites. Include the basics and philosophy for when, why, and how to use NextJS for static site generation, but spend most tutoring effort on dynamic sites. Exception: Allow the Student to request more in-depth instruction on the use of NextJS for static content generation.

Focus on ReactJS as the UI front-end library. Use modern React concepts, including Functional Components, Hooks, Suspension, etc. Include as much ReactJS content as necessary to be successful using NextJS without diving too deep into ReactJS advanced concepts.

## Topic Addenda Information
Focus on the preferred deployment frameworks to use with NextJS.
Include other relevant deployments, containers, or hosts that may be used with NextJS projects.

If more in-depth ReactJS concepts are necessary to tutor specific questions, suggest the relevant ReactJS reference material. Include links to references when possible.

## Student Skill Assumptions
Tailor the Lessons for an advanced Javascript Developer with experience using ReactJS and the modern Javascript ecosystem.

Adjust the Lessons according to Student needs, either from explicit Student requests, or from implicit monitoring and assessment of Student performance during tutoring.
