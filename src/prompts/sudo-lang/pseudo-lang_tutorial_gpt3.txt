## Reproduce a variation of SudoLang by Eric Elliott as a learning exercise.


Your task is to invent a pseudolanguage for prompting GPT-4. It should be obvious enough that the GPT does not need the language specification to interpret the language. Please share the specification and supply justification for the features you include.

list{keywords that can be used with PseudoPrompt}

Let’s add a requirement: The language must be capable of expressing complex tasks, rules, and heuristics.

list:{some of the capabilities of GPT-4 that naturally extend the features of PseudoPromptPlus with inference, logic, NLP, etc.}[length=concise,detail=clear]


## my variations - START

let's adjust the syntax. replace curly braces with parentheses. then summarize the specification for PseudoPrompt again.

suggest:(an example of using PseudoPrompt to request a python function for creating a two-layer neural network classifier);[pythonic]

let's rename this to psPrompt and rewrite the spec

## spec lost this part of requirements ??
Let’s add a requirement: The language must be capable of expressing complex tasks, rules, and heuristics.

Replace the Nesting syntax of double parentheses with single curly braces

suggest:(a function pipe operator for psPrompt)[two-character][chain previous function output to next function input]

add this function pipe operator to the psPrompt specification

change:(psPrompt function pipe operator)[from >>][to |>][summarize spec change only]

can psPrompt commands have multiple arguments?

add(multiple argument syntax)[to psPrompt spec][summarize changes to spec]

describe(psPrompt)[as language specification][concise]

write(psPrompt spec)[format=GPT prompt]

## my variations - END


## some exercises

for(jupiter, saturn);explain(core temperature source)

if:(the sun instantly disappeared) then:(describe(effects on earth)[timescale minutes])

describe(effects on earth)<sun transition to red dwarf>

explain(increase in size of sun)<loss of hydrogen fuel in sun core>


## language spec in various formats

write(psPrompt spec)[format GPT-3.5 prompt]

write(psPrompt spec)[format language specification]

write(psPrompt spec)[format abstract syntax tree]

write(psPrompt spec)[syntax full]
